# Slate Grades
> Browser extension that shows your grades in D2L!

---

## Usage
Just install it as a normal browser addon and it should modify the "Grades" page of D2L to show current grades

> Only certain sites, browsers, etc... are supported

### Browsers
Currently only the following browsers are supported:
- Firefox
- Chrome

## Limitations
- D2L isn't standardized, so the addon might not work for some courses. If the grades table's columns follow the order:
```"Grade Item", "Points", "Weight Achieved", "Grade"
```
Then it should be fine.
