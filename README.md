# Slate Grades
> Browser extension that shows your grades in D2L!

---

## Usage
Just install it as a normal browser addon and it should modify the "Grades" page of D2L to show current grades

<br/>

## Installation
The packages should be in the app store of your respected browser. If not there are packages in this repo which you can install manually.

#### Firefox
1. Download the `d2l_grades-1.0-fx.xpi` file.
2. In Firefox, go to __Addons__ ([Ctrl+Shft+A])
3. Click the gears in the top right -> __Install Add-on From File__
4. Find the `.xpi` package, select it, click __Accept__ on the popup
5. Congrats! Go check your grades in D2L!

#### Chrome
1. I haven't figured out how to manually install in chrome yet :(

## Support
> Only certain sites, browsers, etc... are supported

#### Browsers
Currently only the following browsers are supported:
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/d2lgrades/)
- Chrome

#### Sites
Currently only the following sites are supported:
- Sheridan

<br/>

## Limitations
- D2L isn't standardized, so the addon might not work for some courses. If the grades table's columns follow the order:
```
"Grade Item", "Points", "Weight Achieved", "Grade"
```
Then it should be fine.
